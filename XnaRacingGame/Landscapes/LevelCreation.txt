How to create a Level for RacingGame
==================================

Levels are created in 3D Studio Max (using version 8 or 9)!

Use the existing landscape, which uses the following files:
- LandscapeGridHeights.png for the vertex buffer generation (all 3d points)
- LandscapeMap.dds, LandscapeMapNormal.dds and LandscapeMapHeight.dds for the landscape material
- Material settings in the Landscape class.
If you want to modify this landscape, go ahead, but the game does currently only support this
landscape, if you want to create more, just change the Landscape class (its quite easy).

Update: Due the fact that we can't directly load bitmaps or even use Texture.GetData
on the Xbox360, I created a helper unit test to generate a binary file from LandscapeGridHeights.png.
Please check out Landscape.GenerateLandscapeHeightFile, in the Landscape loading itself
the new file LandscapeHeights.data will be used!

Now import this landscape into 3D Studio Max and use it as your base layout
(1 grid point=10x10 meter=10x10 pixels on LandscapeMap.dds, which means 1 m = 1 pixel!).
You should create an extra scene for the landscape and use XRef Scene to just see the scene, but
not modify it. This is quite useful because we have to click around a lot and don't want to change
the landscape itself, but the track or moving objects around.

Also import the sky using the SkyCubeMap.dds texture for the background (again XRef it).

Tracks use the following textures:
- Road.dds +Normal for the road itself
- RoadBack.dds +Normal for the sides and the side under the road
- Leitplanke.dds +Normal for the left and right side guard rails of the road
- GuardRailHolder model for the piles left and right (ever 20m)
- RoadColumnSegment model for the columns the tracks stands on (ever 100m)
- RoadCement +Normal for the columns itself (the model is just for the ground)
- RoadTunnel.dds +Normal for the tunnels (dont go through the landscape!)

You can create the road track by creating a spline:
- Create -> Shapes -> Spline -> Line
Its easy just to create the spline in the top down view and then modify each point for the height, etc.
You can also do loopings and all kinds of crazy tracks, check out the levels.

Now you can create additional helpers for modifying the track.
- Dummy Helpers (Create -> Helpers -> Dummy) are used to modify the track width.
	The default track width is always 1.0, create a dummy and scale it (select scaling and then use
	Tools->Transform Type-In) to something between 0.25 and 3.0 (more or less does not make much sense).
	To reset the original track width, just set another dummy helper at the position where to stop.
	You can set as many helpers and use as many track variations as you like, the importer will modify
	the track accordinly (changes happen in a smooth manner).
- Point Helpers for creating tunnels. Just start a tunnel with a point helper (Create -> Helpers -> Point)
	and stop them again with another Point helper. If you don't use a second point helper, the tunnel will
	not be created. Both the dummy and the point helpers must be on the track or very close to it (max. 20m
	distance).
	
Finally add models and objects to the level by using 3D Studios XRef feature:
-> File -> XRef Objects ... -> Add models from the game (trees, stones, houses) and set them,
	if a model has multiple meshes, only the first one will be used (e.g. tree trunk is used, but leaves are ignored).

Now export the whole scene excluding the landscape and the sky (which does not matter if you XRef'ed them as
I told you above) with Collada Max 1.0.5 (download here: http://www.feelingsoftware.com/component/option,com_docman/Itemid,80/)
and you have your level, which can be imported by the ColladaImporter class in the game :)

Have fun creating your levels.
